        <p>
            This is not a list of resolutions—it's a declaration of boundaries. 
            These are the habits, behaviors, and commitments I'm intentionally choosing 
            to leave behind as I step into 2026. Sometimes growth isn't about adding more; 
            it's about knowing what to subtract.

            <!-- Card 1 -->
            <article class="card fade-in">
                <div class="card-number">01</div>
                <h3>I will not sacrifice sleep for productivity</h3>
                <p>Rest is not laziness. My best work comes from a well-rested mind, not an exhausted one.</p>
            </article>

            <!-- Card 2 -->
            <article class="card fade-in">
                <div class="card-number">02</div>
                <h3>I will not say yes when I mean no</h3>
                <p>People-pleasing has a cost. My time and energy deserve protection, and honesty is kinder than resentment.</p>
            </article>

            <!-- Card 3 -->
            <article class="card fade-in">
                <div class="card-number">03</div>
                <h3>I will not compare my journey to others</h3>
                <p>Everyone is running their own race. My progress is valid even if it looks different from someone else's.</p>
            </article>

            <!-- Card 4 -->
            <article class="card fade-in">
                <div class="card-number">04</div>
                <h3>I will not scroll mindlessly</h3>
                <p>My attention is valuable. I choose presence over passive consumption.</p>
            </article>

            <!-- Card 5 -->
            <article class="card fade-in">
                <div class="card-number">05</div>
                <h3>I will not hold onto relationships that drain me</h3>
                <p>Some connections are meant to evolve or end. Letting go is an act of self-respect.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="card fade-in">
                <div class="card-number">06</div>
                <h3>I will not wait for perfect conditions</h3>
                <p>Perfection is a myth that keeps us stuck. Done is better than perfect.</p>
